### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, i'm Gustavo (he/his). Some people call me Gus.

I'm a backend developer from Brazil, coding for fun and also to make money (we all need money) for 7 years.
Currently i'm working with TypeScript microservices and testing with Jest. 

In the past days, i coded in Python (oh i love Python), Ruby (which i also love), C# and even Scala. 
Currently i'm willing to learn Go, but also improve my frontend skills, by having a more strong CSS & React skills.

As a side note, i have some interest in UX.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://www.riachuelo.com.br/
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn Go
- âš¡ Fun fact: my github username is intended to be a joke about me
